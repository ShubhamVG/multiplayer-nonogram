# Multiplayer nonogram

If you are like me who lost to too many sudoku games to a [teeny tiny sudoku addicted girl](https://github.com/Dana-f559) and now wants to retaliate in a different game, this might be perfect for you!

There weren't any multiplayer nonogram games, at least one where you didn't make to make an account to play so I decided to make one by my own :)
I may host it on my website too but my wallet hasn't been too happy with me lately, eh. Consider sponsoring or hiring me or something üëç

As most of my projects, the backend is written in Go and the frontend is in flutter.

## TODO
- everything lol
